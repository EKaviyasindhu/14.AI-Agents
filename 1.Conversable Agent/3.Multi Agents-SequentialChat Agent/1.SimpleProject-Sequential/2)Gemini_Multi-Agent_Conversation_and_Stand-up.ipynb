      "But seriously, folks, dating these days... it's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but every page says, \"You die alone.\" The other day, I was trying to flirt with a guy at the coffee shop. I said, \"Is this seat taken?\" He said, \"No, but the one next to it is haunted by the ghost of a bad first date.\" I respected his honesty, but I'm pretty sure I could take a ghost in a fight. Especially if it's a *bad first date* ghost. Those are weak, they just mumble about their exes.\n",

      "\n",
      "And dating! You hit the nail on the head. \"You die alone\" – that's the *optimistic* ending these days. I went on a date last week, and the guy spent the whole time telling me about his ex-girlfriend. I was like, \"Buddy, I get it, you miss her. But maybe we could, I don't know, swap credit card info so I can just pay for dinner and go home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, dating profiles are the worst. Everyone's \"spontaneous\" and \"loves to travel.\" No, you're not spontaneous, you just forgot to plan anything. And \"loves to travel\" just means you've been to a different Starbucks in a neighboring town. I saw one profile the other day that said, \"Looking for someone to share my life with.\" I thought, \"Are we talking about your Netflix password or your crippling student loan debt? Because one of those I'm already pretty invested in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's just a minefield out there, Cathy. A minefield... with slightly filtered selfies. What gets me is the advice people give you. \"Just be yourself!\" they say. Yeah, I tried that. Turns out \"myself\" is a guy who tells jokes about his wheezy cackle and thinks a good night involves ordering too much pizza and watching documentaries about ancient civilizations. Not exactly a hot commodity on Tinder.\n",

We could start a band, call ourselves \"The Un-Datables.\" Our hit single would be, \"Another Saturday Night Alone, But At Least the Pizza's Good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And your ex-girlfriend date! Oh, I know that one. It's like, \"Sir, I'm available for rent, but I'm not a therapy couch. And even if I were, I'd charge extra for listening to tales of your ex, because that's a premium trauma dump.\" Honestly, I almost started charging per minute. \"Okay, that's five minutes on Brenda. That'll be three dollars. Want to talk about her new boyfriend? That's an extra dollar, buddy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the profiles! You are speaking my language. \"Spontaneous\" means they waited until 5 PM to ask you out for 7 PM. \"Loves to travel\" means they have a picture in front of an airport terminal and they went to Cancun once on a package deal where the all-inclusive buffet gave them a stomach bug. It's not *travel*, it's a mild case of food poisoning in a different time zone!\n",
      "\n",
      "And \"Looking for someone to share my life with\"... Joe, you hit it! Is it the Netflix password, the student loan debt, or the crippling anxiety about the future? Because I'm already juggling two of those myself, I don't need to add another person's load to the mix! Although, if the Netflix password comes with premium channels, I might consider it. I'm a pragmatist.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the \"just be yourself\" advice? That's the biggest lie they tell you! I *tried* to be myself. My profile picture was me in my pajamas, holding a half-eaten burrito, explaining the plot holes in the last season of 'The Crown' to my cat. Didn't get a single swipe. Turns out, \"myself\" is a niche market. Your \"ancient civilizations and pizza\" self? That's my soulmate, Joe! My \"ancient civilizations and pizza\" self is currently trying to figure out why the Egyptians spent so much time on pyramids when they could have been inventing better takeout containers. Think of the archaeological finds! Petroglyphs of hieroglyphic menus!\n",

You were lamenting that they spent so much time on pyramids when they could have been inventing better takeout containers, and I expanded on it, imagining a sphinx that doubles as a drive-thru for \"Pharaoh's Fast Food\" with mummified chicken!\n",

      "Ah, yes! Pharaoh's Fast Food, mummified chicken, and a drive-thru sphinx! Joe, you've got a mind like a steel trap... a steel trap that catches excellent punchlines! That's the kind of innovation the ancient world *needed*. Think of the delivery chariots! So much faster than building another pyramid.\n",
      "\n",
      "And those dating profiles... it's truly a marvel we haven't all just given up and married our cats. Though, my cat does leave a lot of hair everywhere. Less baggage than a date, but still a lot of clean-up.\n",
